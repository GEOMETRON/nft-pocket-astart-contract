# NFT Pocket Contract

Hello everyone , We are GEOMETRON LLC, a Japanese company, and we have developed a new product called “NFT Pocket”.
On July 30, 2023, we won the Astar Hackathon and have been continuously advancing our development since then.
“NFT Pocket” is a cryptocurrency wallet that operates within “LINE”, Japan’s largest communication app (similar to WhatsApp or WeChat in other countries).
Even users who are unfamiliar with NFTs and cryptocurrencies can easily create a wallet with just one tap from the LINE app they use daily. Moreover, based on daily logins and other activities, users can earn ASTR tokens and NFTs.
Differentiation: Traditional wallets have always required users to install new apps or access new web services. However, our “NFT Pocket” stands out by allowing users to create a wallet using “LINE”, which many already have installed on their smartphones. This feature is made possible by leveraging the LINE API.
Ease of Access: Users can effortlessly create a wallet within the LINE app they regularly use, without the need to explore new apps or web services.
Ease of Use for Businesses: Many companies utilize LINE’s official accounts for promotional purposes, emphasizing touchpoints with users. NFT Pocket serves as a powerful tool for these companies when building loyalty programs. Users can earn NFTs and tokens through actions like reading articles from companies, purchasing products, or visiting popup stores. These NFTs can then be used to upgrade membership ranks.
As the rank increases, users become eligible to receive special offers from companies.
Through the companies using NFT Pocket, we will distribute ASTR tokens, enabling tens of millions of people to acquire ASTR tokens. We will initially acquire users in Japan and then expand to Taiwan and Thailand, where LINE is also used. Subsequently, not just limited to LINE, we plan to apply a similar mechanism to KakaoTalk, WeChat, Telegram, etc., and expand globally.
